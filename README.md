```Defining VM Volume
fetch the latest ubuntu release image from their mirrors.
when using cloud-images not allowed to increase disk-size
only on localy downloaded image with command:
qemu-img resize images/focal-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk-kvm.img 10G
Tip:
when provisioning multiple domains using the same base image,
create a libvirt_volume for the base image and then define the domain specific ones as based on it.??
